Periodically (at least weekly), I like to make sure I know where all my do do actions are. If they are in projects and my lastest periodic files, I can trust my system; however, if they are buried in my reference files, then I need to move them. So I wrote this simple Obsidian plugin that displays files with - [ ] actions.

To use this plug-in:
1. Copy main.js and manifest.json into my-task-checker folder in plugins
2. Enable a hotkey for task checker

When run Onsidian will do 2 things:
1. Output a list of files
2. Create a file todo-files-YYYY-MM-DD.md in the root of your vault. 

Once done with the list of files simply delete it.
